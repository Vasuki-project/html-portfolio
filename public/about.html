<h1>About Vasuki</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Vasuki, and I’m passionate about chemistry—well, that’s how I started my academic journey. I completed my Master’s in Chemistry and was fully immersed in the world of molecules, reactions, and lab experiments. But, one fateful day, something unexpected happened.

It all started when I was trying to solve a complex chemical equation, and instead of seeing a beautiful reaction, my mind wandered... *What if there was a way to automate this?* What if a computer could solve these equations? The idea of using programming to make science easier, more efficient, and even fun had never crossed my mind before, but when it did—there was no turning back.

I dove into the world of programming, armed with my scientific mindset and a curious heart. I thought, "I’ve cracked chemical bonds, but let’s see if I can crack the code!" From debugging errors (which felt a bit like trying to fix a chemical reaction gone wrong) to building my first program, it felt like discovering a whole new world of endless possibilities.</p>

<h1>The Fun Story That Inspired Me</h1>

<p>Once, I was stuck in a chemistry lab trying to figure out the right concentration of a solution. Nothing seemed to work! I was frustrated. My experiments kept failing like a recipe gone wrong. Out of nowhere, one of my friends who had recently started learning programming jokingly said, "Why not just code your own lab assistant?"

At first, I laughed it off. Code a lab assistant? Ridiculous. But then I thought—what if there was an app that could calculate chemical concentrations? Maybe it wasn’t such a crazy idea after all! 

A few weeks later, after I learned some basic Python (and a lot of coffee), I built a simple program that could automatically calculate the concentrations of solutions based on the inputs I gave it. I was so thrilled when it worked that I felt like a scientist in a science fiction movie. It felt like my chemistry knowledge and programming skills had fused into something magical. 

And that’s when I knew—I wanted to blend my love for chemistry with my new passion for programming. Now, I spend my days exploring how technology can solve real-world problems in science, and I couldn’t be more excited to be part of this ever-growing world of coding!

From a chemist to a coder—my journey is just beginning. And who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll develop a program that can predict the outcome of any chemical reaction. Here's to making the world a little more "chemically" and "programmatically" amazing!</p>
